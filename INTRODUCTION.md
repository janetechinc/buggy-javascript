This is the final coding challenge of the day.

We're going to show you some code that tries to solve the "Soccer Tournament"
problem and some tests. There are failing tests, and we're going to ask you
to fix the tests by modifying the code file.

The difficult thing about this challenge is that both the code and tests are
difficult to read. The tests are accurate. So if the tests pass, then the code
behaves correctly.

The goal of this exercise is to get as many specs passing as possible by making
modifications to the code file. There are more failing specs than most people
finish within the given time, so do not worry if you don't get a full green test
run. You'll be evaluated most on your *approach* to debugging the code.

Modifications to the spec file are allowed, as long as you test all the same things,
but your focus should be *understanding* the specs, and *changing* the code file.
